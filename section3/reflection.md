## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

The first things that stood out to me was that mistakes are essential to the process. I'm coming from a job where mistakes aren't tolerated and can have huge impacts on the process and company. While my current team still seen as learning opportunities, they aren't super common and we have a lot of process and checks in place to ensure they don't happen often. It's becoming clear to me through the pre-work and everything I learn about programing that I will need to change my mindset around mistakes. I need to start thinking of them as valuable to the process instead of a big liability.

The other point that stood out to me was that in this field there will always be room to grow and learn. It's something that really factored into my decision when I finally decided to make the career change. In my previous jobs I've always hit a point where I feel like I had a pretty good grasp of the role and there wasn't much left to learn or new areas to explore. While a little daunting, being in a field that is constantly changing and evolving is part of what drew me towards programing in the first place.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

To go off of what I wrote above, I currently have a hard time seeing mistakes as necessary and important to the process. I think it will take some time and practice in this new field to start embracing them.

I pretty good at seeking about challenges and I'm usually not satisfied if I feel like I'm coasting, in both work and in life. I like that I'll have opportunities to push myself in this field.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Arrays in an app might be used to store a bunch of menu options. You would have a set number of elements and clicking on each element would do a different action.  

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a specific set/ built-in action that does something to, or tells you something about an array, such as telling you the number of elements in the array or adding/ removing an element.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop performs an action for a specific number of times. It's a more effective way of writing code when you want to perform an action over and over again or on a large number of elements without having to write out a line of code for each action. You could use a loop without an array if you want to perform an action over and over again until a certain point without needing elements as an input. Example, printing out something a specific number of times. With an array you can perform a loop on different elements until you hit the end or the array/ or when you specify when you want the loop to stop. Example, printing out each item in the array etc.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is an action you keep performing over and over until you reach a goal. For example, if your goal is to try to make a basket, you shoot the basketball over and over again until you make a basket and then you can stop.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I would like to see loops in arrays in practice in a practical way. I can guess at how they would be used but I think I would have a stronger grasp of them if I could use them on a project.
