## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

* The biggest thing that resonated with me is that learning is a process not a destination. I signed up for Turing to learn how to code and get a job but this was a helpful reminder that I also need to enjoy the process of learning how to code, especially because it's a field where you never stop learning. Now that I'm starting in on the process of learning how to code, I'm remembering how much satisfaction I get out of classes and learning.

* The other main point that really stood out was teaching others as a way to solidify your own knowledge. I've mentored and taught coworkers before and it is a really good way to identify gaps in your knowledge. It's also been a great chance to go back through and update your knowledge base and review the newest techniques.

* I already really enjoy reading but would love to change up my reading list to include some more coding specific books.  

* I need to remind myself to take breaks fairly often. I will start setting an alarm to remind myself to get up and move around for a few minutes.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

* Numbers: Broken down into integers and floats. Integers are positive and negative numbers and floats are fractions/ decimals.

* Strings: a group of characters inside of quotes. The characters can be letters, numbers etc.

* Boolean: Data types that are either true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```console.log('Hello World!');
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

//
Comments allow you to add notes and explanations to your code. It's important to help other developers understand what is happening in your code and is a good reminder when going back through your old code. Anything that you comment out will not be run so it's also a good tool for testing.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a way to storing and organizing data. You can also assign values to variables and those values can change later on in the code.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Robinhood:
username = 'String'
loggedIn = Boolean
accountBalance = floats

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

A concatenation is a way to join together variables in a string or multiple strings. Uses '+'

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Netflix: 'who is watching' + username

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

The additional reading on comparison operators was a bit confusing, particularly around null and undefined. I would love to see more examples/ look up a further explanations.
