## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique? 

It felt a little different using this technique, but it was difficult to use it in the way that it was intended. I ended up having to work through the exercises in really small parts over the week around the rest of my schedule, so I didn't have a huge block of time to sit down and try it out. In the one long block of time that I did work through, it was helpful to have a structured break and a reminder to stop. I think it will be a useful technique once I'm doing this full time.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I found my time estimates to be a little off. I feel like when I set my intentions I was able to get the section I wanted to go done finished but I felt like the time it took wasn't as long as I estimated.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An Object is a way to store more complex data than an Array. An Arrays data is set in a fixed order and you need to know where a piece of information is to access it. An Object instead allows you to store information connected to Strings. You can access the data using the assigned string instead of having to know the index.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  An Array, it's all the same data type and it wouldn't make sense to build a unique key for each value.

  * List of states and their capitals
  It would make more sense to store this as an object so that you can use key-value pair to keep track of which state goes with which capital.  

  * List of things to pack for vacation
  I would most likely store them in an array. All of the items would be strings and order wouldn't matter, nor would they need to be connected to a key.  
  If you wanted to categorize them into categories (clothes, toiletries etc.), it might make more sense to store them in an object and have the value be an array of items in that category.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  An array. All the instagram handles are the same data type and it wouldn't make sense to build a unique key for each value.

  * List of student names and their cohort
  An object so you can use key-value pairs to keep the student name and cohort connected.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  Object, you would be able to store all of the ingredients as keys and the amount of each values.

  * All my favorite restaurants
  An Array, similar reasons as before. They are all the same data type and there's no information that needed to be stored in a value.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

A reddit post could be an object.
Keys:
content (post of a link to an article), time (11:15 pm), comments ('these are my throughs on this article...'), upvotes (50), awards (gold, silver) etc.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I struggled a bit with building the method that would allow me to add new comments to the Tweet object. I got it in the end but need more practice putting the concepts together.
