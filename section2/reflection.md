## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

In my normal environment I ask questions at the right time. I feel like I have a good grasp of the expectations and flow of my work. However I think going into Turing and learning a completely new skill will change that. I have a tendency to wait to ask questions for a little too long. I think recognizing that issue is the first step and way I might be able to work around it is by starting with asking questions in smaller groups. I also think with some practice, I'll have a better handle on timing and what is most appropriate/ works best for me with coding.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It felt comfortable. There was one minor issue that I worked through (typo). I think by having us try to jump in and do these things on our own helps with muscle memory and shows gaps in current understanding. The outside resources were helpful in getting me to start thinking about where I might find answers to solutions and I how I might learn best outside of regular Turing classes.


1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

Ex. If you're tired go to bed.
Ex. If password is correct (true) log in.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You use if else. As the computer reads through the code it checks if each if or if else statement is true. If it evaluates to true it runs the code in that block. If false it moves on to the next if else statement. If it reaches the end / the else statement without any of the previous statements being true then it will run the last block of code.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

You can build an if else statement and pass in two conditions. If you use the && operator the conditional statement will check if both conditions are true and will only run the block of code if they both are. If you use the || operator it will check if one of the two conditions are true. 

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

No questions on the stuff we covered but I'm curious about building more complex functions and what else you can do with them.
